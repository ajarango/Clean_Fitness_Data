### Desc.

This Code book will provide some additional info about the process of cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis. This is a requirement of the Johns Hopkins Data Science course 'Getting and Cleaning Data'

### Source Data
A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.


### Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Section 1. Read in and merge all files. Combining all data sets for one master 'endData' set for analysis. There were two main sets used from a 'Test' batch and a 'Train' batch as follows:

- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

Headers were not imported so Column names were assigned

## Section 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
A Logical vector was created made up exclusively of TRUE values with mean and std dev. columns placed in set all extraneous columns were removed. 


## Section 3.  Use desc. activity names	to name the activities in the data set
 Merge the endData with the activityType table to include names

## Section 4. Label the data set with the activity names 
Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

## Section 5. Create export file 'TidyData.txt' and export for upload
